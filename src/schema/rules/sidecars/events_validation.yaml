EventsMissing:
    code: EVENTS_TSV_MISSING
    description: |
        Task scans should have a corresponding events.tsv file.
        If this is a resting state scan you can ignore this warning or rename the task to include the word "rest".
    level: warning  # could be an error with the proper selectors, I think
    selectors:
    - entities contains "task"
    - entities.task != "rest"
    - entities.task not contains "rest"  # Alternative for including the word "rest"
    checks:
    - associations contains "events"
