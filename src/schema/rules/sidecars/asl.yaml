                SLICE_TIMING_NOT_DEFINED_2D_ASL: |
                    "You should define SliceTiming', in case 'SequenceType' is set to a
                    2D sequence. 'SliceTiming' is the time at which each slice was
                    acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing
                    is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing the
                    time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning
                    of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice
                    axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the
                    proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check
                    if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if
                    `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are
                    defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis, such that the
                    final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice 0.
                    Without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible."
