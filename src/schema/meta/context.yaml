#
# The context provides the namespaces available to rules.
# These namespaces are used by selectors to define the scope of application
# for a rule, as well as assertions, to determine whether the rule is satisfied.
#
# Not all components of the context will be defined; for example a NIfTI header
# will only be defined when examining a NIfTI file.
#
# The dataset namespace is constructed once and is available when visiting all
# files.
#
# The subject namespace is constructed once per subject, and is available when
# visiting all files within that subject.
#
# All other (current) namespaces are defined on individual files.
# Sidecar metadata and file associations are built according to the inheritance
# principle.
